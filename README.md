# **Predicting Churn at Telco**

## About the Project
### Goals
Churn is defined as the rate at which customers leave a company. This is bad for business, as it often costs more to attract new customers than to keep current customers. The goal of this project is to determine which customers from Telco are more likely to churn. While it would be impossible to eliminate churn completely, simply reducing the rate of churn could save the company a significant amount of revenue.
### Background
### Data Dictionary
The Telco Churn data base contains four tables. The visual I created below shows each table name with the features in each, along with the foriegn keys that connect them together.

# **Project Steps**
## Acquire & Prepare
### acquire.py
Data is aquired from the company SQL database. Login credentials are required. Functions are stored in the [acquire.py](https://github.com/ThompsonBethany01/Telco_Churn/blob/master/acquire.py) file, which allows quick access to the data. Once the aquire file is imported, it can be used each time using the data.
